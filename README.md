    Mayan EDMS is a wonderful product with a lot of features.
    However, its sheer number of features and capabilities can be a bit intimidating for the average user.
    This is where Open Paperless comes in. Open Paperless is a re-think
    of the user interface and user experience for Mayan EDMS.
    The goal is to reduce the complexity and make it more suitable for
    home users. Think of Open Paperless as a lightweight version of Mayan EDMS.
